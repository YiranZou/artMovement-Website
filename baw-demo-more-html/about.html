       <p1>Pop art started with the New York artists Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, and Claes Oldenburg, all of whom drew on popular imagery and were 
actually part of an international phenomenon. Following the popularity of the Abstract Expressionists, Pop’s reintroduction of identifiable imagery (drawn from mass media 
and popular culture) was a major shift for the direction of modernism. The subject matter became far from traditional “high art” themes of morality, mythology, and classic history; 
rather, Pop artists celebrated commonplace objects and people of everyday life, in this way seeking to elevate popular culture to the level of fine art. Perhaps owing to the 
incorporation of commercial images, Pop art has become one of the most recognizable styles of modern art.</p1>

<p2>
The majority of Pop artists began their careersin commercial art: Andy Warhol was a highly successful magazine illustrator and graphic 
designer; Ed Ruscha was also a graphic designer, and James Rosenquist started his career as a billboard painter. Their background
in the commercial art world trained them in the visual vocabulary of mass culture as well as the techniquesto seamlessly merge the realms of 
high art and popular culture.</p2>
