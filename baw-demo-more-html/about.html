		Pop art started with the New York artists 
Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, James 
Rosenquist, and Claes Oldenburg, all of 
whom drew on popular imagery and were 
actually part of an international phenomenon. 
Following the popularity of the Abstract 
Expressionists, Pop’s reintroduction of 
identifiable imagery (drawn from mass media 
and popular culture) was a major shift for the 
direction of modernism. The subject matter 
became far from traditional “high art” themes 
of morality, mythology, and classic history; 
rather, Pop artists celebrated commonplace 
objects and people of everyday life, in this 
way seeking to elevate popular culture to the 
level of fine art. Perhaps owing to the 
incorporation of commercial images, Pop art 
has become one of the most recognizable 
styles of modern art.


The majority of Pop artists began their careers
in commercial art: Andy Warhol was a highly
successful magazine illustrator and graphic 
designer; Ed Ruscha was also a graphic 
designer, and James Rosenquist started his 
career as a billboard painter. Their background
 in the commercial art world trained them 
in the visual vocabulary of mass culture as well as
the techniquesto seamlessly merge the realms of 
high art and popular culture.
